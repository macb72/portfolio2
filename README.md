# Mohamed Arfat's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

This project showcases my work and achievements, built with modern web technologies to provide a sleek, responsive, and interactive experience.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This portfolio was created using:
- **ReactJS** for a dynamic and component-based user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** for a highly customizable and responsive design.
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and engaging transitions.

## ðŸ“¦ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.\
The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on testing, check out the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production and optimizes it for the best performance.\
The production build is minified, and filenames include hashes to ensure caching is handled properly. The build is ready for deployment!

For more details on deployment, refer to the [Create React App deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning: This is a one-way operation.**\
If you need to customize the build configuration beyond the defaults, you can eject from Create React App. This will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control. However, this action is irreversible and should be done with caution.
